        <h2>What is a Mortgage?</h2>
        <p>A mortgage is a loan specifically used to purchase real estate. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan, meaning if you fail to make payments, the lender can foreclose on the property.</p>

        <h2>Current Mortgage Rates 2025</h2>
        <p>As of January 2025, mortgage rates have continued to evolve with market conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>30-year fixed:</strong> 6.2% - 6.8%</li>
          <li><strong>15-year fixed:</strong> 5.7% - 6.3%</li>
          <li><strong>5/1 ARM:</strong> 5.5% - 6.2%</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Mortgages</h2>
        
        <h3>Conventional Loans</h3>
        <p>These are the most common type of mortgage, not backed by the government. They typically require:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Down payment: 3% - 20%</li>
          <li>Credit score: 620+</li>
          <li>Debt-to-income ratio: Below 43%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FHA Loans</h3>
        <p>Government-backed loans with more lenient requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Down payment: As low as 3.5%</li>
          <li>Credit score: 580+</li>
          <li>Mortgage insurance required</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>VA Loans</h3>
        <p>For eligible veterans and service members:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No down payment required</li>
          <li>No private mortgage insurance</li>
          <li>Competitive interest rates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Qualify for a Mortgage</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Check Your Credit Score</h3>
        <p>Your credit score is one of the most important factors. Higher scores mean better rates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>740+: Best rates available</li>
          <li>680-739: Good rates</li>
          <li>620-679: Standard rates</li>
          <li>Below 620: Limited options, higher rates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Calculate Your Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
        <p>Lenders prefer a DTI ratio below 36%, with no more than 28% going toward housing costs.</p>

        <h3>3. Save for Down Payment</h3>
        <p>While some loans allow low down payments, putting down 20% helps you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI)</li>
          <li>Get better interest rates</li>
          <li>Have lower monthly payments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Mortgage Application Process</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Get Pre-approved</h3>
        <p>Before house hunting, get pre-approved to understand your budget and show sellers you're serious.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Shop for Rates</h3>
        <p>Compare offers from at least 3-4 lenders. Even a 0.25% difference in rate can save thousands over the loan term.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Submit Your Application</h3>
        <p>Gather required documents:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay stubs (last 2 months)</li>
          <li>Tax returns (last 2 years)</li>
          <li>Bank statements</li>
          <li>Employment verification</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Home Appraisal</h3>
        <p>The lender will order an appraisal to ensure the home's value supports the loan amount.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Closing</h3>
        <p>Review all documents carefully before signing. Bring a cashier's check for closing costs.</p>

        <h2>Tips to Get the Best Mortgage Rate</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong> Pay down debts and fix any errors on your credit report</li>
          <li><strong>Shop around:</strong> Different lenders offer different rates</li>
          <li><strong>Consider points:</strong> Paying points upfront can lower your rate</li>
          <li><strong>Choose the right loan term:</strong> 15-year loans have higher payments but lower rates</li>
          <li><strong>Make a larger down payment:</strong> 20% down typically gets the best rates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mortgage Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Not shopping around for the best rate</li>
          <li>Making major purchases before closing</li>
          <li>Choosing a payment that stretches your budget</li>
          <li>Forgetting about closing costs and ongoing expenses</li>
          <li>Not reading the fine print</li>
        </ul>
